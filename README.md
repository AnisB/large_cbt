This repository contains a project that implements the technique described in the paper [**Concurrent Binary Trees for Large-Scale Game Components**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02215) published at the conference *High Performance Graphics 2024* and detailled at the Talk [**Advances in Real-Time Rendering in 3D Graphics and Games**](https://advances.realtimerendering.com/) at *Siggraph 2024*.

This demo relies on **DX12** and some **Shader model 6.6** features. Here are the steps to get it running:

- Clone the repo and open a terminal in the root folder of the repo
- Create a build folder or **mkdir build**
- Move to that folder or **cd build**
- Open a terminal if it is not already the case and type **cmake ..**

This will generate a solution that you can open in Microsoft Visual Studio and the demo project is **outer_space**

In order to interact with the scene, you must hold the right click of your mouse!

You can also download the [pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/AnisB/large_cbt/releases) from the repository releases.

Cheers!
